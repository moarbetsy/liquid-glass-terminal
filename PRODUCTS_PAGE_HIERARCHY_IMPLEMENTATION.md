# Products Page Hierarchy Implementation

## Overview
Updated the ProductsPage component to support the new 3-layer hierarchical product structure as defined in the product category hierarchy specification.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Category-Based Product Display (Requirement 5.1)
- **Grouped Display**: Products are now displayed grouped by category with collapsible sections
- **Category Headers**: Each category shows the category name and product count
- **Expand/Collapse**: Users can expand or collapse individual categories or all at once
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between categories and products within them

### 2. Enhanced Product Editing Interface (Requirement 5.2)
- **Category Selection**: Product form now includes category selection dropdown
- **Product Type Support**: Added support for product type assignment (optional)
- **Size Management**: Dynamic size and price management with add/remove functionality
- **Custom Units**: Support for custom unit specification (g, ml, unit)

### 3. Required Category and Type Assignment (Requirement 5.3)
- **Mandatory Category**: Category selection is now required when adding new products
- **Product Name Required**: Product name is mandatory for all products
- **Type Optional**: Product type is optional but supported for variants
- **Validation**: Form validation ensures required fields are completed

### 4. Stock Level Tracking (Requirement 5.4)
- **Individual Stock**: Each product variant can have its own stock level
- **Stock Controls**: Increment/decrement buttons for easy stock management
- **Stock Status**: Visual indicators for stock levels (good/low/out)
- **Size-Specific**: Stock tracking at the product level (can be extended to size-specific)

## Technical Implementation

### New Interfaces
```typescript
interface CategoryProductItem {
  categoryName: string;
  productName: string;
  typeName?: string;
  sizes: { [size: string]: number };
  allowCustom?: string;
  stock: number;
}
```

### Data Conversion
- Converts `CATEGORY_CONFIG` to flat list for management interface
- Handles both products with types and products with direct sizes
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing structure

### UI Components
- **CategoryHeader**: Collapsible category sections with product counts
- **ProductRow**: Enhanced product display with hierarchy information
- **ProductForm**: Comprehensive form for category-aware product management

### Features Added
- Search across categories, products, and types
- Expand/collapse all categories functionality
- Price range display for products with multiple sizes
- Enhanced product information display
- Improved form validation and user experience

## Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for hierarchy support
- Validates category configuration structure
- Tests product grouping and conversion logic
- Ensures compatibility with both typed and direct-size products

## Future Enhancements
- Size-specific stock tracking
- Bulk product operations
- Category management (add/edit/delete categories)
- Product import/export functionality
- Advanced filtering and sorting options

## Files Modified
- `src/components/ProductsPage.tsx` - Main component update
- `src/lib/__tests__/productsPageHierarchy.test.ts` - New test file
- Added comprehensive TypeScript support for new interfaces

The implementation fully satisfies requirements 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and provides foundation for 5.4 (stock tracking per size can be extended as needed).
