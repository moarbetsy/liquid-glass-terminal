# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dynamic order count badge that displays next to the "Orders" menu item in the navigation. The badge provides real-time visibility into the number of uncompleted orders, helping users immediately understand how many orders require their attention without needing to navigate to the orders page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to see a badge count next to the "Orders" menu item that shows the number of uncompleted orders, so that I can quickly assess my workload without navigating to the orders page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a badge next to the "Orders" menu item showing the count of orders with "uncompleted" status
2. WHEN there are 1 or more uncompleted orders THEN the system SHALL display the badge with the correct numerical count
3. WHEN there are 0 uncompleted orders THEN the system SHALL hide the badge completely
4. WHEN the badge is displayed THEN it SHALL show only numerical values (no "0" display)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the order count badge to update immediately when I change an order's status, so that I have accurate real-time information without needing to refresh the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order status changes from "uncompleted" to "completed" THEN the system SHALL automatically decrement the badge count by one
2. WHEN an order status changes from "uncompleted" to "paid" THEN the system SHALL automatically decrement the badge count by one
3. WHEN the badge count decreases to 0 THEN the system SHALL hide the badge immediately
4. WHEN the badge count increases from 0 THEN the system SHALL show the badge immediately
5. WHEN order status changes occur THEN the system SHALL update the badge without requiring a page refresh or manual reload

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the order count badge to reflect changes made from any part of the application, so that the count remains accurate regardless of where I update order statuses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN order status is updated from the Orders page THEN the system SHALL update the badge count in real-time
2. WHEN order status is updated from the Dashboard THEN the system SHALL update the badge count in real-time
3. WHEN order status is updated from any other component THEN the system SHALL update the badge count in real-time
4. WHEN multiple orders are updated simultaneously THEN the system SHALL reflect the cumulative change in the badge count

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the order count badge to have consistent visual styling with the application's design system, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the badge is displayed THEN it SHALL use the application's existing glassmorphism design patterns
2. WHEN the badge is displayed THEN it SHALL use consistent typography and color scheme with other UI elements
3. WHEN the badge is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned appropriately next to the "Orders" menu item
4. WHEN the badge updates THEN it SHALL use smooth animations consistent with the application's motion design
5. WHEN the badge appears or disappears THEN it SHALL use appropriate transition effects
