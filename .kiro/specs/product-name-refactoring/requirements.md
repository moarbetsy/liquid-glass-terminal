# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive refactoring of all product names throughout the Liquid Glass Business Terminal application. The current product names need to be replaced with standardized 2-letter abbreviations to maintain consistency and improve the user experience. This change affects the product catalog, user interface components, data storage, tests, and all related functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want all product names to use standardized 2-letter abbreviations so that the interface is consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all product names SHALL display using the new 2-letter abbreviations
2. WHEN viewing the product catalog THEN all categories SHALL show products with updated names
3. WHEN creating orders THEN the ordering terminal SHALL use the new product names
4. WHEN viewing order history THEN existing orders SHALL display with updated product names
5. WHEN exporting data THEN all exported files SHALL contain the new product names

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want existing data to be automatically migrated so that my historical orders and inventory remain intact with the new naming convention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN existing localStorage data SHALL be automatically migrated to use new product names
2. WHEN viewing historical orders THEN all past orders SHALL display with the updated product names
3. WHEN checking inventory levels THEN stock quantities SHALL be preserved under the new product names
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful data conversion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code references to be updated so that the codebase maintains consistency and future development uses the correct naming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing source code THEN all product name constants SHALL use the new abbreviations
2. WHEN running tests THEN all test cases SHALL pass with the updated product names
3. WHEN adding new products THEN the naming convention SHALL follow the 2-letter abbreviation pattern
4. WHEN searching the codebase THEN no references to old product names SHALL remain
5. WHEN building the application THEN no compilation errors SHALL occur due to naming changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive test coverage so that the renaming changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all product-related tests SHALL pass with new names
2. WHEN testing the ordering flow THEN product selection SHALL work correctly with new names
3. WHEN testing data persistence THEN products SHALL save and load correctly with new names
4. WHEN testing search functionality THEN users SHALL be able to find products by new names
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN error handling SHALL work properly with new product names
